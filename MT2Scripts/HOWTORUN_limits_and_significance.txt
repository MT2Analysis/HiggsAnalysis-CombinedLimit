###
Once all single datacards have been created using createDatacards:

1. need to combine cards for each model/mass point:
python combineCards_scan.py pathOnSE (see inside the script for an example)

2. need to run limits:
python submitLimits_scan.py pathOnSE (see inside the script for an example)

3. need to run significance:
python submitSignificance_scan.py pathOnSE (see inside the script for an example)

###
Once jobs are finished, can copy limits/significance on your scratch are, then read:

4. copy limits/significance
sh copyLimits.sh model label SEPath (see inside the script for an example)
sh copySignificance.sh model label SEPath (see inside the script for an example)

5. read limits/significance
sh readAsymptoticLimits_Scan.sh model label
sh readPLSignificance_Scan.sh model label

###

This will create a txt file for limits, and a txt file for significance, one per model.
Once you got this, then you need to convert the txt file in a root file, running interpolation and smoothing:

6. run the python script:
python drawSMSLimit.py fileWithLimits.txt

### Note: for significance, keep the txt file. Bruno and Mario to work on similar script for interpolation...
